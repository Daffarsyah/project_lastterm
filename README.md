This project developed an interactive visual dashboard to explore the impact and contribution of co-benefits at the micro level. The data used came from The Data Lab's 2025 data visualization competition, which included various variables such as air quality, road safety, physical activity, noise, and a key metric called Total Impact.
The analysis is descriptive and comparative, using two approaches. First, Total Impact is used as a benchmark to compare and rank the overall performance of each area. Second, Selected Impact is calculated dynamically based on the user's chosen co-benefit categories. This separation was made so that the interpretation of the data remains clear and not misleading, while also allowing room for flexible exploration. To facilitate reading, comparisons between areas are focused on groups of areas with the highest impact values (Top-N).
The essence of this dashboard is to show that areas with high Total Impact do not necessarily have similar co-benefit contribution patterns. Some areas are dominated by a particular category, while others show a more even distribution of benefits. Through interactive features, users can see which categories are most influential, understand the differences in the characteristics of each region's impact, and make comparisons both in aggregate and in detail.
Technically, the dashboard was built using HTML and CSS for the interface, JavaScript for data processing and interaction, and Plotly to create various visualizations such as bar charts, donut charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots. The result is an informative, accurate, and easy-to-use dashboard to support data exploration and communication.
